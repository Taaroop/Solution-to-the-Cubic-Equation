# Solution-to-the-General-Cubic-Equation
# This is a complete note on solving general cubic equations (it involves Tartaglia's Method of solving Depressed Cubics and Cardano's Substitution to convert a General Cubiic Equation to a Depressed Cubic).
# I was too lazy to type the formula into Python! (Plus, numerical methods like Newton Raphson are way simpler and short!!)
